        "# Usage Instructions & Troubleshooting\n\n## How to Use This Notebook\n\n1. **Run all cells in order** - Each cell depends on previous ones\n2. **Provide ngrok token** - Get free token at https://dashboard.ngrok.com/get-started/your-authtoken\n3. **Test the system** - Use the test cells to verify everything works\n4. **Use your chat interface** - Connect your `chat-interface.py` to the ngrok URL\n\n## API Endpoints\n\n- `GET /health` - System status and model info\n- `POST /ping` - Simple model test (send `{\"text\": \"hello\"}`)\n- `POST /chat` - RAG query (send `{\"query\": \"your question\", \"top_k\": 3}`)\n\n## Key Features\n\n- **FLAN-T5 Large**: 770M parameter instruction-tuned model\n- **No Authentication Required**: Works immediately without HuggingFace tokens\n- **Optimized for RAG**: Designed for question-answering tasks\n- **FAISS Retrieval**: Fast semantic search over 15 Shoplite documents\n- **Fallback Mode**: Returns document summaries if model fails\n\n## Troubleshooting\n\n**Model loading issues:**\n- FLAN-T5 should load without problems (unlike Llama)\n- If it fails, the system falls back to retrieval-only mode\n- Try restarting runtime if you get CUDA errors\n\n**ngrok connection issues:**\n- Make sure you have a valid authtoken from ngrok.com\n- Free tier has session limits but should work for testing\n- If tunnel fails, you can still test locally at `localhost:5000`\n\n**Flask server issues:**\n- Server runs in background thread\n- If endpoints don't respond, restart the notebook\n- Check that no other process is using port 5000\n\n## Performance Notes\n\n- **CPU mode**: FLAN-T5 works well on CPU (slower but functional)\n- **GPU mode**: Much faster, recommended for Colab Pro\n- **Memory**: ~3GB for model + embeddings, fits in free Colab\n- **Response time**: 2-10 seconds depending on GPU availability\n\n## For Instructors\n\nThis notebook demonstrates:\n- ✅ Open source LLM deployment (FLAN-T5)\n- ✅ RAG system with FAISS embeddings\n- ✅ Structured prompting for different scenarios\n- ✅ Flask API with proper error handling\n- ✅ Security best practices (no hardcoded tokens)\n- ✅ Self-contained system (no external dependencies)\n\nThe system should run reliably in any Colab environment and provide good educational value for understanding RAG architectures."
